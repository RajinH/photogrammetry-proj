# Photogrammetry Project

## Description

Repository consisting of relevant Jupyter Notebooks and Python programs to achieve a working prototype of a photometric stereo setup. This will later be extended to a working mobile app in the future that is capable of converting high-res images with flashlight configurations into accurate normal maps for down-the-stream applications.

## Project Set Up

- `src/` - contains source code for the python application
- `scratchbook.ipynb` - contains experimental code and idea validations
